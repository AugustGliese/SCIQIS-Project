    "#### Describing how any quantum system evolves in time is determined by an initial state $\\ket{\\psi_0}$ and a Hamiltonian, $2^n \\times 2^n$ Hermitean matrix. The state at a later time is calculated using the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation:\n",
    "#### $i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial\\ket{\\psi(t)}}{\\partial t} = H $$\\ket{\\psi(t)}$\n",
    "#### This can be solved on a general form such that the state after a time t is given by\n",
    "#### $\\ket{\\psi(t)} = e^{-iHt} \\ket{\\psi(0)}$\n",
    "#### Here $\\ket{\\psi(0)}$ is the initial state you start from. This is a powerful equation that can simulate time evolution of quantum systems. However, the process quite quickly breakdown as the size of the Hamiltonian and by extension the states become to large to be simulated on computers. Quantum computers have some algorithms that can help with this scaling problem, but the Hamiltonian might be extremely complicated to implement as an unitary operation. In the following we will go through Trotter decomposition that approximates the Hamiltonians used in time evolution."
