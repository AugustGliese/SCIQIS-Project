# SCIQIS-Project
This is a repository for the project for scientific computing in quantum information science at DTU, https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/10387 - This project is about Hamiltonian simulation with a focus on Trotter decomposition. 
In this project we explore the Trotter decomposition. This is done for the Ising Hamiltonian with 2 sites, and hopping terms.
The first and second order Trotter decomposition is compared.
The circuits are decomposed into more universal gates: abritrary Z rotation gate, CNOT, Hadamard and S.
On these gates noise can be added to varying degrees.
